        The 2019 Show Me Mock Trial Case has been released! 
    </p>
    <p>
        On October 4, the Circuit Court for the City of St. Louis will hear the case of Chris Whistler v.
        Oak Gardens Earth Residence. Whistler, the nursing home’s cook, alleges he/she was discharged
        from his/her employment in violation of the Whistleblower’s Protection Act, after complaining to
        both his/her employer and the Department of Health and Senior Services that an non-potty-trained
        puppy was creating sanitation problems in the nursing home. The nursing home denies the
        claims, alleging that Whistler was discharged from his/her employment for engaging in
        conversations with residents that caused medical problems for the residents instead of doing
        his/her job. Will Whistler be compensated? Find out October 4-6, 2019, at the Show Me Mock
        Trial Invitational.
