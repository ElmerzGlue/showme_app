      What is so great about this tournament? PRACTICE! All teams have the same number of trials,
      which provides all teams with similar opportunity to learn and improve. Also, individual
      attorneys and witnesses are ranked by the judges and some will receive individual awards based
      on individual performance. Finally, the whole tournament starts and stops over one weekend, where
      students will meet other mock trial students from other schools and groups during meals and the
      awards ceremony.
